## What is a moduli space?
An isomorphic object of a class of objects
### Examples
- All the possible(or an infinite number of) poison dart frogs in the world ![poison dart frogs](https://ts1.cn.mm.bing.net/th/id/R-C.5438e59546d31ea0d014d2a16732db8c?rik=Z84i2d3SRk5pog&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.herpera.com%2fimages%2ffrogAS.jpg&ehk=Yi0vwcBHPcUzjgb1Ai%2fYTYF1sA8rY2AZFpXAT%2bOQAzc%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0) $\to$ A hyperplane in the space of traits of poison dart frogs
- The solutions of $x^n = 1$ $\to$ $\mathbb Z_n$(any integer modulo $n$)
- All possible ways to enroll a circle in $\mathbb T^2$(Torus) $\to$  $\pi(\mathbb T^2) = \mathbb Z^2$(two integers)
- Solutions of a harmonic oscillator ![HO sol](https://tse3-mm.cn.bing.net/th/id/OIP-C.W6Wl030UJLdNBKeUmpYa1gHaFH?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain) $\to$ A series of discrete numbers called energy spectrum, or non-negative integers $n$ denoted as particle numbers
- A free particle solution in QFT $\to$ Spectrum in the phase space of mass, spin, charges, etc.
- The vacua configurations of a field theory $\to$ Some geometric objects in the space of field profiles(or VEVs(vacuum expectation values) if we assume the translational invariance of vacua)
### What is the point of studying moduli spaces?
Moduli spaces are motivated by **classifying**(and maybe visualizing) a bunch of complicated stuff as some **isomorphic**(i.e. of the same shape) objects.
So we can **distinguish** different classes of things by their moduli spaces.
## What can I do with ModuliSpaces.jl?
### Prob the moduli spaces
A variant of the traditional blind searching(e.g. depth-first searching and breadth-first searching) algorithms that incorporates a hierarchy among vertices. It prioritizes the exploration of higher hierarchy vertices, thereby optimizing the search process in hierarchical graphs
### Understand the moduli spaces from their symmetries and topological properties(TODO)
### Visualize the moduli spaces(TODO)
